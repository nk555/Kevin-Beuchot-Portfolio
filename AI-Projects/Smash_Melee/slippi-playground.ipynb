    "As we can see state and flags are interesting properties to look at. They contain information about things like landing, jumping, getting hit, etc. It will be useful to know what to expect and maybe to see if we want to keep all or group some characterisics. Something else to notice is that many names for example the buttons and states first have some numbers (probably as input for the actual game to read) but we only care of the words describing it. Something else I want to use is speed and possibly we can compute it by the change in position on pre and post but maybe I need to use previous frames. Knowing speed is useful as it can tell not only if a character is running (which has impact on what actions can be taken) but it also tells us a better picture to know how fast a character can get to a certain position compared to only knowing its position. If it is running left then it is unlikely it can reach right except in certain states like foxtrotting or dash dancing."
